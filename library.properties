sentence=Arduino library for NAU7802 24-bit ADC based load cell and weigh scale modules.
paragraph=This library provides an easy-to-use interface for the NAU7802 24-bit low-noise ADC commonly used with load cells and weigh scale applications. It supports I2C communication, programmable gain amplifier (PGA), internal LDO configuration, selectable sample rates, raw ADC reading, averaging, tare (zeroing), scale calibration using a known weight, and stable weight measurement output. Designed for beginner-friendly and production-ready use on Arduino and ESP platforms.
